# AVR-Assembler-Touch-Panel

In this project I program AVREasyV7 to program a GLCD component and 
a touch panel controller.
When we start the program the GLCD shows us numbers and we have to click
then to introduce a pin. 
If we introduce the correct pin the GLCD shows UNBLOCKED, if we dont it
shows FAILED!.
